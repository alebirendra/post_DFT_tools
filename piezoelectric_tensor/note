\section*{1. Dielectric Constant of SrTiO\(_3\)}

\subsection*{1.1 Room Temperature Dielectric Properties}
At room temperature, SrTiO\(_3\) (STO) is in the cubic perovskite phase (\(Pm\bar{3}m\)) and exhibits a dielectric constant (\(\epsilon_r\)) of approximately:
\[
\epsilon_r \sim 300
\]
This high value arises due to the soft phonon modes associated with the \( \text{TiO}_6 \) octahedra. However, the electronic contribution to the dielectric constant, often referred to as \( \epsilon_\infty \), is much lower, typically around \( 5.59 \) to \( 6.34 \). 

\subsection*{1.2 Calculation Considerations}
Using Quantum ESPRESSO with input parameters \( \text{epsil} = .\text{true.}, \text{trans} = .\text{false.} \), the calculated value of \( \epsilon_r = 6.08 \) corresponds to the electronic contribution (\( \epsilon_\infty \)) and excludes phonon contributions, which are significant for the static dielectric constant (\( \epsilon_0 \)).

\subsection*{1.3 Recommendations}
To calculate the static dielectric constant (\( \epsilon_0 \)), include phonon contributions by enabling \( \text{trans} = .\text{true.} \) in the input file. This allows the computation of LO/TO phonon mode splitting, essential for capturing ionic polarization effects.

\section*{2. Ferroelectricity in SrTiO\(_3\)}

\subsection*{2.1 Pure SrTiO\(_3\)}
STO is not ferroelectric under ambient conditions due to its centrosymmetric cubic structure. Below \( \sim 105 \, \text{K} \), STO transitions to a tetragonal phase (\( I4/mcm \)), but it remains quantum paraelectric due to quantum fluctuations suppressing spontaneous polarization.

\subsection*{2.2 Induced Ferroelectricity}
Ferroelectricity can be induced in STO by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strain Engineering:} Epitaxial strain can break the symmetry and stabilize a ferroelectric phase.
    \item \textbf{Doping:} Substituting Sr or Ti atoms with elements like Ba or Ca.
    \item \textbf{External Electric Fields:} High electric fields can induce polarization.
\end{itemize}

\section*{3. Differences Between Ferroelectricity and Piezoelectricity}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ferroelectricity:} Materials exhibit a spontaneous, reversible polarization, e.g., BaTiO\(_3\), and require non-centrosymmetric polar structures.
    \item \textbf{Piezoelectricity:} Materials generate electric charge under mechanical stress and do not necessarily have spontaneous polarization, e.g., Quartz, AlN.
    \item \textbf{Relation:} All ferroelectric materials are piezoelectric, but not all piezoelectric materials are ferroelectric.
\end{itemize}

\section*{4. Si-Doped SrTiO\(_3\) as an Anode Material for Lithium-Ion Batteries}

Si-doping in SrTiO\(_3\) introduces several advantages for its use as an anode material:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Electrical Conductivity:} Si-doping introduces donor electrons, increasing conductivity.
    \item \textbf{Structural Stability:} The perovskite matrix buffers against volume changes during lithiation/delithiation.
    \item \textbf{Improved Ion Diffusion:} Si-doping modifies the lattice, reducing migration barriers for lithium ions.
    \item \textbf{Suppression of Volume Expansion:} The rigid SrTiO\(_3\) lattice confines Si expansion, minimizing degradation.
    \item \textbf{Tunable Electrochemical Properties:} Bandgap engineering through Si-doping optimizes the redox activity.
\end{itemize}

\section*{5. Summary}

SrTiO\(_3\) is a versatile material with remarkable dielectric and paraelectric properties. While it is not inherently ferroelectric, it exhibits tunable characteristics under strain, doping, or external fields. In energy storage applications, Si-doped SrTiO\(_3\) offers promising benefits as an anode material due to its stability, conductivity, and structural adaptability.
